// 4. Explain with your own example the difference between entry-controlled and exit-controlled loops by writing a short code snippet for each (for/while vs do-while) and describing what happens if the loop condition is false at the start.

#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{

    // 1. Entry-Controlled Loop:
    // Condition is checked before the loop body, so if it is false initially, the loop does not execute.

    int i = 5;
    while (i < 5)
    {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    }

    printf("Loop End");

    // 2. Exit-Controlled Loop:
    // Condition is checked after the loop body, so the loop executes at least one time even if the condition is false initially.

    do
    {
        printf("%d\n", i);
        i++;
    } while (i < 5);

    printf("Loop End");
}
